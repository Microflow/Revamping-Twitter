# Revamping-Twitter

## Phase One: Add a Microfinance Toolbar to Twitter, and use it to get everyday Americans Jobs, and help them raise money for projects.

## Phase Two: Start to Open Source Twitter.

Let people set up their own local node.The public and programmers will go nuts. Imagine the reaction on hacker news. 

Keep an advertising navbar or footer, that links back to your own ad feed API. Then you can still profit.

## Phase Three. Rewrite Twitter in Erlang

Roll the project out over a year. 

Keep the CSS and JS in the client untouched. 

Rewrite a small backend in Erlang, or Elixir/Phoenix, and see if you can serve a good version with 1000 users only. Then gradually port users over, 5,000 at a time.

You don't even need to port over every tweet. Just those from the last year, say. So do it gradually, both in terms of blocks of users, and blocks of time. 

Take your time and enjoy it. 

Hire Jose Valim and Chris Mccord if it pleases you.

Some techies like to create jobs for themselves. One pair of hustlers tried to charge me 80 bucks to clone an Android Repo once. I told them it would take 3 mouse clicks, as Android Studio imports the libraries automatically. 

They went silent. 

Imagine that kind of bluffing at Twitter Scale. Lots of liberal tards creating work for themselves. 

~O~

Doing it my way would cause ZERO disruption to the original Twitter. You are not changing anything on the original servers, or messing with their code. That could be disastrous, and there would be loads of pushback. 

Just completely rewrite it, from the ground up, keeping the beautiful browser code, [b]in a separate project. Have it running on TwitterNew.io or something, so hardcore fans could help you test it out.[/b] 

About 6 months in, you will have two Twitters running in parallel. The old monstrosity, which still suffers form legacy problems due to it being written in Ruby on Rails from day one.

And your new svelte version, written in Erlang. 

Techies love to get paid to reinvent the wheel. 

Then you can see what is most efficient to run.

More later, if GLP dialogue continues.

## First GLP thread. Hope it doesn't get wiped. 

Start by using Twitter to feed the homeless, get everyday American's jobs, and help them raise money for their dreams.

Will communicate here. 

Hold the Line.
