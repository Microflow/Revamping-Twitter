## Phase One: Add a Microfinance Toolbar to Twitter, and use it to get everyday Americans Jobs, and help them raise money for projects.

## First GLP thread. Hope it doesn't get wiped. 

Start by using Twitter to feed the homeless, get everyday American's jobs, and help them raise money for their dreams.

Will communicate here. 

Hold the Line.
